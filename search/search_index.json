Subsequent invocations (if performed before timeout \u2013 i.e. while the cursors are still highlighted) will cycle     through the cursors in the view.  The focus modes are iterative mode (the default) and pan mode.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Iterative Mode: Iterative mode is the default. This will cycle through each cursor centering it in the view.     Iteration only occurs when the command is ran an additional time while the cursors are still in their     highlighted state. If run after they have reverted to their original state, FindCursor will just show the next     off screen cursor. For this reason, iterative mode doesn't work too well from the command palette as the command     is slow to activate from the command line; iterative mode is not provided by default in the command palette     for the these reasons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pan Mode: Pan mode, or panning mode, will pan through the cursors in your view.
