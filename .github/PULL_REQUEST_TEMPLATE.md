## Pull Request Checklist
Thanks you for contributing to this project!  Here are a few things to help this pull go smoothly.  Pulls that do not follow this will not get merged.

- Please describe the change in as much detail as possible so I can understand what is being added or modified.

- If you are solving a bug that does not already have an issue, please describe the bug in detail and provide info on how to reproduce if applicable (this is good for me and others to reference later when verifying the issue has been resolved).

- Please reference and link related open bugs or feature requests in this pull if applicable.

- Make sure you've documented or updated the existing documentation if introducing a new feature or modifying the behavior of an existing feature that a user needs to be aware of.  I will not accept new features if you have not provided documentation describing the feature.

- If issues are noted in code review, they must be addressed in a reasonable time frame or the issue will be marked stale.  Stale requests run the risk of being closed.
