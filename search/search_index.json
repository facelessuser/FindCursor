Subsequent invocations (if performed before timeout \u2013 i.e. while the cursors are still highlighted) will cycle     through the cursors in the view.  The focus modes are iterative mode (the default) and pan mode.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Iterative Mode: Iterative mode is the default. This will cycle through each cursor centering it in the view.     Iteration only occurs when the command is ran an additional time while the cursors are still in their     highlighted state. If run after they have reverted to their original state, FindCursor will just show the next     off screen cursor. For this reason, iterative mode doesn't work too well from the command palette as the command     is slow to activate from the command line; iterative mode is not provided by default in the command palette     for the these reasons.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pan Mode: Pan mode, or panning mode, will pan through the cursors in your view.  While iterative mode will     focus each cursor individually while the in the high visibility state, pan mode will just jump to the next group     of offscreen cursors.</p> </li> </ul> Parameters Type Description <code>reverse</code> boolean Controls the direction of cursor focusing when either iterating or panning through cursors. <code>pan</code> boolean Controls whether the command will run in pan mode or iterative mode. <p>Screencast demonstrating the differences of pan vs iterative:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#defining-keymaps","title":"Defining Keymaps","text":"<p>Setting up commands is basically the same for either pan or iterative commands.
