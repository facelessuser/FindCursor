## Requirements

Please read and fill in the template below.  Make sure you've read: http://facelessuser.github.io/FindCursor/contributing/.  If the template is not followed, the issue will be marked `Invalid` and closed.

Search past issues and read the area of the [documentation](http://facelessuser.github.io/FindCursor/) related to your specific question, issue, or request. Often the answer to your question is already found there.  You may also find the feature you are requesting already exists. It is okay if after doing this you are still confused, just mention what you didn't understand in the documentation below so we can make it better.

## Description

Vague issues/requests will be marked with `Insufficient Details` for about a week.  If not corrected, they will be marked `Stale` for about a week and then closed.

For feature requests or proposals:

- Clearly define in as much detail as possible how you imagine the feature to work.
- Examples are also appreciated.

For bugs and support questions:

- Describe the bug/question in as much detail as possible to make it clear what is wrong or what you do not understand.
- Provide errors from console (if available).
- Pictures or screencasts can also be used to clarify what the issue is or what the question is.
